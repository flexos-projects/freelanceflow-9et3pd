# Vision & Strategy

This document outlines the high-level product and business goals for FreelanceFlow. It serves as our north star, guiding our decisions from feature prioritization to design choices.

## Vision Statement

To be the all-in-one operating system for modern freelancers, empowering them to manage their business with clarity, confidence, and efficiency.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide a simple, intuitive, and powerful platform that centralizes client management, project execution, time tracking, and financial administration. By automating administrative overhead, we free up freelancers to focus on their craft and grow their business.

## Strategy

Our go-to-market strategy is centered around a product-led growth model. We will win by delivering tangible value quickly and building a deeply integrated workflow that becomes indispensable to our users.

1.  **Nail the Core Workflow:** Our initial focus, as detailed in the [Features Document](./002-features.md), is to perfect the fundamental freelance loop: managing clients, creating projects, tracking time, and generating invoices. This is the bedrock of the application.

2.  **Delightful User Experience:** We will differentiate ourselves from clunky, enterprise-focused tools with a clean, fast, and aesthetically pleasing interface. The design system, outlined in the [Design Document](./006-design.md), will prioritize simplicity and clarity.

3.  **Introduce a Client-Side Value Proposition:** The Client Portal is a key strategic element. It transforms FreelanceFlow from a solo tool into a collaborative platform, creating stickiness for the freelancer's clients and reinforcing the freelancer's professionalism.

4.  **Data-Driven Insights:** The Dashboard will be more than just a data repository; it will be an actionable intelligence hub. We will provide clear visualizations of revenue, project profitability, and time allocation to help freelancers make smarter business decisions.

5.  **Expand through Integrations:** Post-MVP, we will focus on integrating with essential tools in the freelancer's stack, such as payment gateways (Stripe) and accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), to become the central hub of their business operations.

## Personas

We are building for two primary user personas:

*   **Alex the Designer:** A freelance graphic and web designer who juggles 5-7 clients at any given time. Alex bills hourly for most work and needs to meticulously track time against different projects. 
    *   **Pains:** Forgetting to log hours, messy spreadsheets for invoicing, disorganized client feedback via email, and chasing late payments.
    *   **Needs:** A simple way to start a timer for a project, a clear view of unbilled hours, and a professional way to send invoices and get paid online.

*   **Chloe the Consultant:** A marketing consultant who works with clients on both project-based fees and monthly retainers. Chloe's success depends on demonstrating value and progress to her clients.
    *   **Pains:** Manually creating weekly status reports, scope creep from clients, and difficulty forecasting monthly revenue.
    *   **Needs:** A central place to manage deliverables, a client-facing portal to show progress, and tools for recurring invoicing and financial forecasting.

## Success Metrics (First 12 Months)

*   **Activation:** Achieve 1,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs).
*   **Engagement:** 60% of active users create at least one invoice per month.
*   **Core Task Completion:** 50% of new users successfully create a client, project, time entry, and invoice within their first week.
*   **Retention:** Achieve a 3-month user retention rate of 35%.
*   **Business Viability:** Reach $5,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) via a subscription model.
